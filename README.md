# TTP LED sign battery powered
A small, battery-powered version of my original TTP LED sign project.
See the original project [here](https://github.com/tobiashellerslien/TTP_LED_sign).

# Introduction
I made this version mainly to challenge myself to learn some new skills, and to give as a fun little gift. Being battery-powered, the sign doesent need any cables and therefore looks much nicer when mounted. The base is made to be able to slide easily on and off the wall mount, with magnets securing it in place. The purpouse is so that you don't need to have the entire sign hanging all the time, you can just slide it on the small wall mount when you want to use it.

# Parts
You will need:
- 8x Ã˜4mm magnets
- 1x 30x70mm perfboard
- 6x red LEDs
- 1x small switch
- 1x 150ohm resistor
- A 2xAA battery holder
- Access to a 3D printer and soldering equipment

# Assembly
Solder the parts after the circuit diagram. Print the parts, and glue the magnets in the holes. After that, glue the slide add-on to the base, so the wall-mount can slide in and holds the sign in place. Glue the battery holder to the base, so that the batteries can be switched out through the hole in the bottom. Then glue the switch in the hole in the side and the perfboard on top of the battery holder. At last, glue the face on to seal it off. You may want to add some plastic in the inside of the face to diffuse the light a little bit.

# Why TTP?
Its a secret I can't tell you
